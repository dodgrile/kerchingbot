Get interesting Stripe events direct to your FB messenger

Messenger code built up using this tutorial:
https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/

- set it up so that multiple users can use the service, rather than one hardcoded FB user
- split some of the logic out so it looks like proper code :)
